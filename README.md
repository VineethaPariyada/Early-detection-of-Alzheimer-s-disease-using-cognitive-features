# Early-detection-of-Alzheimer-s-disease-using-cognitive-features

This repository contains the implementation of a novel ensemble machine learning technique for the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease, focusing on the use of cognitive features. The approach leverages the **Neighborhood Component Analysis and Correlation-based Filtration (NCA-F)** for feature selection, helping to identify key cognitive factors that contribute to the prediction process.

The ensemble model integrates an **adaptive weight matrix** to select the most effective classifiers based on their performance, improving the accuracy of Alzheimer's detection over traditional methods like artificial neural networks. The combination of **feature selection** and **adaptive voting** within this ensemble model provides a more robust and accurate solution for detecting Alzheimer's in its early stages.

### Key Features:
- **NCA-F Feature Selection**: Identifies the most relevant cognitive features for Alzheimer's detection.
- **Adaptive Voting Mechanism**: Dynamically weights classifiers to improve overall model accuracy.
- **Ensemble Machine Learning**: Combines multiple algorithms to create a more powerful predictive system.
  
This technique aims to revolutionize early Alzheimer's detection by significantly improving diagnostic accuracy, offering a promising alternative to conventional methods.
