# Early-detection-of-Alzheimer-s-disease-using-cognitive-features
This repository contains the implementation of a novel ensemble machine learning technique for the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease, focusing on the use of cognitive features. The approach leverages the Neighborhood Component Analysis and Correlation-based Filtration (NCA-F) for feature selection.
